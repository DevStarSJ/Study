YESTERDAY
The Beatles
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half to man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, I yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go I don't know she woldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away.
Why she had to go I don't know she woldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday. Mm mm mm mm mm.
